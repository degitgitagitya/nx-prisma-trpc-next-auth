# Nx Monorepo with Next.js, Prisma, NextAuth.js, and TRPC

This Nx workspace provides a robust foundation for building modern web applications using:

- Next.js: Server-rendered React framework for dynamic and performant UIs.
- Prisma: Type-safe ORM for interacting with your PostgreSQL database.
- NextAuth.js: Simplified authentication flows for user management.
- TRPC: Efficient RPC (Remote Procedure Call) framework for API communication.

### Structure:

The workspace is organized using Nx, enabling efficient development and management of multiple applications and libraries within a single codebase.

### Getting Started:

1.  Prerequisites: Node.js and yarn installed.
2.  Clone Repository: Obtain the source code for this Nx workspace.
3.  Install Dependencies: Navigate to the workspace root and run `yarn install` to install all required dependencies.
4.  Configure Database: Set up your PostgreSQL database and configure connection details in environment variables (`packages/db`).
5.  Define Data Model: Create your Prisma schema file (prisma/schema.prisma) inside `packages/db` to define your database models.
6.  Running the Application:
    - Develop: Start the development server with `nx serve <app-name>`. Replace <app-name> with the actual name of your Next.js application.
    - Build: Generate an optimized production build using `nx build <app-name>`.
    - Additional Notes: Refer to the official documentation for each technology (Next.js, Prisma, NextAuth.js, TRPC) for in-depth usage and configuration details.

Nx provides various commands for managing your workspace, including testing, linting, and building libraries. Consult the Nx documentation for a comprehensive guide.

This is a concise README that provides a basic overview of the technologies used and how to get started with development. You can expand upon it with specific instructions for setting up the database, authentication, and API routes using TRPC. Consider including links to the official documentation for each technology for further exploration.
